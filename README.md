# ANTS2D
Numerical simulation of ants searching for food in a 2D board

This is a FORTRAN code designed to simulate the behavior of ants searching for food in a 2D board. The program was designed just for fun, but I believe it could be useful to perform some social experiments based on the logic of ants working in a cooperative mode to search for food. 

I recorded a Youtube video in my channel (in portuguese) explaining the logic and the ideas behind this code, here is the link:
